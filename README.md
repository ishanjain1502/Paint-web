# Paint-web
This is a fun paint web app.<br/>
One fine day I discovered about canvas in html5, so tried tinkering up with it.<br/>

<h2>Initial development-</h2>
1. It only had one color and thickness too cannot be changed.<br/>
2. it only had inputs via mouse and no touch.<br/>

As of now I was using eventListener for mouse to draw the objects on canvas, but I was facing a problem of not able to undertake the ones which required touch inputs

<h2> Repo Updated  :fire: :fire:- </h2>

1. You can pick color as per your desire with the help of picker. :satisfied::satisfied: <br/>
2. I have also added the thickness changer which uses the range type to change thickness of brush ðŸ˜‡:innocent: <br/>
3. I have added functionality of undo,clear and eraser too ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž<br/>
<br/>
And now it looks like this -
